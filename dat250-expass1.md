# dat250assignment1

## technical problems
My laptop did not have enough space for java, gradle, intellij and podman, so I fixed it, by buying a new ssd.




## how you have validated (checked) that the software development environment is working
By doing this assignment, I validated that java, intellij, gradle and podman work.



## conclusion
Other than that, I did not encounter any other technical problems, nor any other issue.
