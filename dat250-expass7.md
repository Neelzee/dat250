# Technical Problems

During the completion of the tutorials, I encountered a few technical challenges that required some troubleshooting and resolution:

RabbitMQ Queue Visibility: At one point, I wanted to view the queues created during the tutorials to better understand the messaging process. To do this, I had to enable a plugin in RabbitMQ. It wasn't immediately obvious, and I had to refer to the RabbitMQ documentation to figure out how to enable the management plugin. Once enabled, I was able to access the RabbitMQ management interface by visiting localhost:15672 and logging in using the default guest credentials. This step allowed me to visually inspect the queues, which was beneficial for learning and debugging.

# Code Repository

The code for the experiments can be found in my GitHub repository under the 'a7' directory. I used Python for these experiments.

# Pending Issues

None.
